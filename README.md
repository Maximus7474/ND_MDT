# ND_MDT

This is a police MDT with many useful features, I plan on making a dispatch panel to go with this sometime and probably another MDT more specific for EMS.

I started this project over two years ago and didn't complete it for different reasons, I've now went back and completed it. Most of the code is still ~2 years old but I did rewrite some parts to make it better and right now it should be good to use with a couple rare minor bugs that I probably didn't find during testing which I'll fix if there's issues created about them.

This resource is created for [ND_Core](https://forum.cfx.re/t/wip-nd-core/4792200?u=andyyy7666) and is also compatible with [ESX](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx_core) but I might integrate it with QB in the future if there's any interest.


## Future plans
* Flash officer status if panic button is on
* Create Keybind for panic button, needs to be clicked twice to prevent accidental click
* Create call when panic button is pressed and attach all available officers to the call
* Dismiss calls that are old
* Dispatch panel
* EMS Version

## Create call
```lua
exports["ND_MDT"]:createDispatch({
    caller = "John Doe",
    location = "Sandy shores", -- not required
    callDescription = "Whiteness bank robbery",
    coords = vec3(x, y, z) -- if this is used and location isn't used then it will still display the location from these coords.
})
```

## Inventory item:
```lua
["mdt"] = {
    label = "MDT",
    weight = 800,
    client = {
        export = "ND_MDT.useTablet"
    }
}
```

## ESX Support by [Maximus7474](https://github.com/Maximus7474)
**IMPORTANT** use the SQL files in `bridge/esx/database` if not the resource will not work.
Still to do:
  * Custom Phone Functions
  * Custom Property Functions
  * Custom Billing Functions
  * Saving a new profile picture for ND_Core (present for ESX -> goto file `bridge/nd/server.lua:121 - Bridge.updateProfilePicture()`)
  * -> For the time being there is no Default billing system integrated, it is present but commented as esx_billing requires a destination for the money. You can activate it in: `bridge/esx/server.lua:299`

#### Don't hesitate in opening issues ;)
